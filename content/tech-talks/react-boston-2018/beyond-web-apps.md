  Can we create or port an existing native desktop application to a complete "React powered" web-app matching (or even exceeding) the quality of the legacy desktop app? Sounds like a good challenge! And this is what I decided to do with my game-making software. This talk will explain all the problems I had and solutions that I used to port my native app written in C++, to a full React + WebAssembly app - while still keeping all existing features! Spoiler alert: At the end, it works.
