title: React & GraphQL – Bringing Simplicity to Client Side Development

  One of React’s stronger attributes is the component model which allows us to combine behavior and presentation of functional units as opposed to along the arbitrary technology focused separation previously used, but unfortunately had less to say about data needs. With GraphQL we can have an ideal final slide to allow our components to fully encapsulate all of their requirements while keeping things modular and reusable. In this talk we’ll cover both the theory and practice of client development with React and GraphQL, along the way highlighting the areas where we can even more strongly leverage its power and flexibility.
