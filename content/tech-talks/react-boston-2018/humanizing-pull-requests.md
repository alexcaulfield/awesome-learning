  Code reviews are an important part of a developer’s life. It’s very easy to perform code reviews, but hard to do it with empathy. In today’s online world, online criticism can be misinterpreted easily. Hence in this talk, we will go through what is a pull request, how to effectively create one, how to give constructive feedback and also how to respond to one using empathy.
