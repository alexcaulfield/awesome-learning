  Working on multiple enterprise projects that use the same components can get a little overwhelming. I will talk through how to create an effective workflow by showing examples of what worked and did not work for our team, from design QA to constant props. As well as how we tackled component documentation that stays up to date with API changes. Lastly, we will explore new ideas that we will want to explore like working with AirBnb's react-sketchapp.
