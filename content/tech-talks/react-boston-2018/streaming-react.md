  The talk aims to shed some light on two things: a) React DOM's stream renderer that allows React components to be rendered to streams on the server and piped to a browser's response, and b) Browsers' added support for streams that harness their streaming HTML parsers. The way these technologies combine allow the creation of performant, powerful web applications with impressive time-to-interactive metrics.
