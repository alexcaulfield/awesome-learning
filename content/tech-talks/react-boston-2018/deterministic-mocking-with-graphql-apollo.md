  Tests are an integral part of the development life cycle, but it isn’t always clear what the most efficient way to write them is. Learn some of the Dos & Don'ts when it comes to testing your React app with Apollo components. We’ll explore: When is a unit test appropriate? When should you lean on integration tests? And how the heck do you dynamically mock GraphQL responses with data specific to your tests? ezCater has solved these problems and is happy to announce its newest edition to the open source community: Lunar, a package to help you mock GraphQL data for your integration tests!
