  For eons, web developers have paved the path forward for innovation on the web platform. We’ve spawned countless design patterns, APIs, and libraries, all which fill some gap to help us write resilient modern web applications. These early experimentations have often found their way into our native web platform. In the age of JavaScript compilers, React is no exception, and it boldly leaps forward with creative and opinionated solutions on how we productively write performant UI code. In this talk, we’ll deconstruct the virtual DOM, synthetic events, JSX and all the other things that make React unique, helping you understand the cost of this controversial web platform delta.
