  Developers are usually familiar with the phrase, progressive web app (PWA), but aren't 100% sure of what it is. Most would be surprised to know that they are about 50% of the way there with most of their applications just through best practices. Once you have a checklist for creating PWAs, you'll be able to take any web application and apply it regardless of the framework you use.

  React in particular makes it incredibly easy to create PWAs or to update your current React apps and make them PWAs. In this talk, we'll cover the 8 necessary attributes of a PWA, some of the advanced PWA attributes, and how to create/update React apps to make them PWAs. By the end of this talk, attendees should have a concrete understanding of what a PWA is and how to make one with React.
