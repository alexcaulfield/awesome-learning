  At this point, most of us have been on at least one team that took agile seriously. You participated in all of the ceremonies, groomed your backlogs, and tracked your team’s velocity. It can often seem like scrum is the only way to build good software. However, there are companies who are successfully building great software without running two-week sprints. Recently, Ryan Singer from the Basecamp team released a book called “Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters” that explores an alternative to our common agile practices. In this talk, we will cover the main points in Shape Up — from shaping, to betting, to building. You will walk away with a high-level understanding of this successful alternative to agile, and will have everything you need to try it out in your own team.
